# image-factory
This project was about modifiying existing Java code and create a factory class. The application allows you to load an image and apply certain filers on it (also known as operation). There are 6 filters (operations) in total. (This project was part of university coursework)

# Objective
- Create a factory class and individual classes for each filter (operation) and remove all the references to the operation classes from the ImageProcessor class (the main class).
- The factory class must be able to add or remove filter (operations) only.
